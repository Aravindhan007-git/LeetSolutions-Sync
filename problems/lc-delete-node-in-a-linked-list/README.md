## Problem Statement

There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not be given access** to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

	- The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.

	- The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.

	- All the values before `node` should be in the same order.

	- All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

**Custom testing:**

	- For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.

	- We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.

	- The output will be the entire list after calling your function.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
**Output:** [4,1,9]
**Explanation: **You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
**Output:** [4,5,9]
**Explanation: **You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

 

**Constraints:**

	- The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.

	- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

	- The value of each node in the list is **unique**.

	- The `node` to be deleted is **in the list** and is **not a tail** node.

## Solutions

```Python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        node.val = node.next.val
        node.next = node.next.next
```
